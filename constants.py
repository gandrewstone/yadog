AttrType  = "type"              #?? This attribute is the type.  For example given the declaration "int a = 5", the "type" is "int". Although this field is OPTIONAL (will be defaulted to ""), it is especially important to supply the type or the valid types (in function arguments) for "untyped" languages so the user/caller knows what to expect.
